CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.5
------------------------
 o The following function is updated
   + topGOres: Drosophila is supported now, significantly enriched gene ids are retuned, plotting of GO terms.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.4
------------------------
 o The following functions are updated
   + GRannotate, distanceFromTSS, matchEnhancers: TxDb with ensemble gene ID are now incorporated for annotation (earlier only TxDb with EntrezID were supported).

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.3
------------------------
 o The following functions are updated
   + GRannotate, TSS: Txdb with duplicate transcript name was resulting in error in these functions. Now all the transcripts with duplicate transcript name are removed before performing annotation.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.2
------------------------
 o The following functions are updated
   + findLncRNA
   + GRannotateSimple
