CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.4
------------------------
 o The following function is updated
   + GR2fasta: The function is updated to handle out of limit GRanges which will not be trimmed.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3
------------------------

 o The following function is updated
   + GRannotate, GRangesInPromoters, getPromoterClass: The functions are updated to create consistency in how the transcripts are retreived from txdb.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2
------------------------
 o The following function is updated
   + GRcoverageSummit: the BAM file base-coverage can now be optionally corrected based on a control BAM file (subtracting the control base-coverage, after normalizing both for library size), before looking for the maximum coverage position (summit).

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.5
------------------------
 o The following function is updated
   + topGOres: Drosophila is supported now, significantly enriched gene ids are retuned, plotting of GO terms.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.4
------------------------
 o The following functions are updated
   + GRannotate, distanceFromTSS, matchEnhancers: TxDb with ensemble gene ID are now incorporated for annotation (earlier only TxDb with EntrezID were supported).

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.3
------------------------
 o The following functions are updated
   + GRannotate, TSS: Txdb with duplicate transcript name was resulting in error in these functions. Now all the transcripts with duplicate transcript name are removed before performing annotation.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.2
------------------------
 o The following functions are updated
   + findLncRNA
   + GRannotateSimple
